We are excited to announce the launch of **Lenz**, our next-generation unified video analytics platform. Lenz represents a significant leap forward in how enterprises manage, monitor, and extract insights from video streams.

## Why We Built Lenz

Modern enterprises face an overwhelming challenge: managing thousands of video streams while extracting meaningful insights in real-time. Traditional approaches fall short when it comes to scalability, performance, and ease of use.

Lenz addresses these challenges head-on with:

- **Unified Stream Management** - Monitor all your video feeds from a single, intuitive dashboard
- **AI-Powered Analysis** - Leverage cutting-edge computer vision for real-time insights
- **Enterprise-Grade Scalability** - Handle thousands of concurrent streams without breaking a sweat

## Key Features

### Real-Time Analytics

Lenz processes video streams in real-time, delivering instant insights through our proprietary AI models. Whether you're detecting anomalies, tracking objects, or analyzing crowd behavior, Lenz handles it all.

```typescript
// Example: Configuring a Lenz analytics stream
const stream = lenz.createStream({
  source: "rtsp://camera.example.com/feed",
  analytics: ["face-detection", "crowd-counting"],
  alerts: {
    crowdThreshold: 100,
    notifyOnAnomaly: true,
  },
});
```

### Seamless Integration

Lenz integrates seamlessly with your existing infrastructure. Our REST API and SDK make it easy to embed video analytics into your applications.
