We are excited to introduce **Lenz**, Nodeflux's AI-powered Video Management System (VMS) built for enterprises that need to manage large-scale camera deployments. Lenz brings all your cameras into one dashboard — giving your team a unified command center for live monitoring, AI-driven analysis, and real-time alerting.

## All Cameras, One Dashboard

Organizations today operate hundreds or thousands of cameras across multiple sites, but most video management systems struggle to keep up. Fragmented tools, high latency, and limited analytics capabilities create blind spots in security operations.

Lenz solves this with a unified platform designed for scale:

- **1000+ cameras** supported in a single deployment
- **24/7 live monitoring** with continuous streaming
- **Sub-100ms stream latency** for real-time situational awareness
- **99.9% uptime SLA** for mission-critical operations

## What Lenz Does

### Unified Stream View

Monitor all camera feeds from a single, organized dashboard. Lenz provides custom grid layouts from 1x1 to 8x8, drag-and-drop camera arrangement, and full-screen single camera mode — so operators can see everything at once without switching between tools.

### Event History and Detection Logs

Every AI detection is captured with timestamps, thumbnails, and classification metadata. Operators can browse a chronological event timeline, preview thumbnails for quick identification, and drill into detailed detection records.

### Analytics Dashboard

Lenz visualizes detection statistics across all analytics modules in real-time. Track patterns from face recognition to vehicle monitoring, analyze trends over time, and export reports with a single click.

### Alert Management

All security alerts are managed from a centralized dashboard. Lenz supports third-party integrations — including Telegram, Email, and Webhook — so alerts reach the right people through the channels they already use. Every alert is logged with a complete audit trail.
